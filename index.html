    <h1><em>Welcome!</em></h1>

    <p>
        I am a Master's Student working under the supervision of Dr. John Paul Minda at Western University in London, Ontario. I research how we (humans) learn to sort stimuli into discrete categories and how category experience impacts the way we process information. I am interested in assessing stimulus representation using neuroimaging techniques and cognitive assessments.

        Outside of research, I enjoy running, sewing, playing video games, reading & writing about science, and keeping up with current events. I began sewing during the COVID-19 pandemic and it has since become one of my primary hobbies; I often combine this skill with embroidery. Take a look at my <em>about</em> page and my blog to see some examples of my work! In addition to sharing my sewing, I also plan to share some of my latest reading, #TidyTuesday submissions, and some general reflections.
