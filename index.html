         My research focuses on ecologically valid approaches to category acquisition.

        More specifically, I'm interested in how smartphone integration and risk (physical or social) impact the trajectory of learning complex stimulus-response mappings.

        People tend to acquire real-world categories (or <em>concepts</em>) through various short, temporally distinct learning experiences. This differs from the typical lab-based category learning paradigm, in which learning occurs in one or few long training sessions. My MSc thesis found that, in a smartphone-based category learning task, temporal distinctivness was better at facilitating learning. My current work explores other ways to strengthen ecological validity and learning outcomes in this area of research.
