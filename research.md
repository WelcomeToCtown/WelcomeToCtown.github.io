    <h1>Research Overview</h1>

    <p>
        I am interested in understanding how humans learn to sort stimuli into discrete equivalence classes based on their features (what one might call the <em> classical</em> view of categorization). This research often takes place in a controlled setting, but applications of category learning are visible just about everywhere. For example, a baseball player going up to bat will categorize an incoming pitch as a <em>ball</em> or a <em>strike</em>; they will not announce their category judgment, but will decide to swing or not swing based on their judgment.
