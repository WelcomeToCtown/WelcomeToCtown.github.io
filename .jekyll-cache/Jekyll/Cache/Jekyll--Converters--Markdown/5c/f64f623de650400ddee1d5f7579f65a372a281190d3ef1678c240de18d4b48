    <h1>Random Response Simulator</h1><br />
    <p>
        In a category learning study, some participants are bound to respond randomly instead of trying to learn the task. The degree to which a random responder's overall accuracy may differ from chance levels is dependent on the study design.

        How many categories are involved?

        How many stimuli are presented during one block of learning?
