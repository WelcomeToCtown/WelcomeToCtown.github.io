    <h1>Random Response Simulator</h1><br />
    <p>
        In a category learning study, some participants are bound to respond randomly instead of trying to learn the task. The degree to which a random responder's overall accuracy may differ from chance levels is dependent on the study design.
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>How many categories are being learned?</li>
            How many stimuli are presented during one block of learning?<br />
        </ul>

        My shiny app runs Monte Carlo simulations to determine what levels of performance may be reasonably expected from a random responder.
