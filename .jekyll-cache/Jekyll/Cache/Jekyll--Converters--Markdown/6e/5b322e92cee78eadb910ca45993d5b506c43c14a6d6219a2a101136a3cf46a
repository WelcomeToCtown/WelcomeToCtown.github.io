    <h1>Random Response Simulator</h1><br />
    <p>
        In a category learning study, some participants are bound to respond randomly instead of trying to learn the task. Theoretical chance levels (i.e., 50% for two-category systems) provide a good point of reference for random responders, but the amount of variation from this theoretical chance level that may be reasonably expected is dependent on the study design.

        How many categories are involved?

        How many stimuli are presented during one block of learning?
        This shiny app simulates random responders and indicates what level of performance might be too high for a participant to be responding randomly.
