    <h1>Research Overview</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
        I am interested in understanding how humans learn to sort stimuli into discrete equivalence classes based on their features (what one might call the <em> classical</em> view of categorization). This research often takes place in a controlled setting, but applications of category learning are visible just about everywhere. For example, a baseball player going up to bat will categorize an incoming pitch as a <em>ball</em> or a <em>strike</em>; they will not announce their category judgment, but will decide to swing or not swing based on their judgment.

        Although there is great value to uncovering the absolute truths of our universe, humans cannot often act on these truths. Instead we rely on our perceptions of the world, which are often riddled with bias based on our beliefs and experiences.
