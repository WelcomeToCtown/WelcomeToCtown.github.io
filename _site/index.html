         My research focuses on ecologically valid approaches to category acquisition. 
    </p><br>
    <p>
        More specifically, I'm interested in how smartphone integration and risk (physical or social) impact the trajectory of learning complex stimulus-response mappings.

        People tend to acquire real-world categories (or <em>concepts</em>) through various short, temporally distinct learning experiences. This differs from the typical lab-based category learning paradigm, in which learning occurs in one or few long training sessions. My MSc thesis found that, in a smartphone-based category learning task, temporal distinctivness was better at facilitating learning. My current work explores other ways to strengthen ecological validity and learning outcomes in this area of research.

        Outside of research, I enjoy running, sewing, playing video games, and keeping up with current events. I began sewing during the COVID-19 pandemic and it has since become one of my primary hobbies; I often combine this skill with embroidery. Take a look at my <em>about</em> page and my blog to see some examples of my work! In addition to sharing my sewing, I also plan to share some of my latest reading, #TidyTuesday submissions, and some general reflections.
